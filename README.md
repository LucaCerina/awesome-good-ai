# Awesome AI for good
A curated list of machine learning or AI related projects that work for the benefit of humanity and not for greed or hype.

The scope of this list is to give visibility to projects in ML and AI space that are away from Big Tech greed and try to do things for the benefit of humanity.
If you want to add something to this list, open a Pull Request.

## What should be in this list
* Anything that is small, independent, and comes from communities. AI should not be the new weapon of colonial empires or greedy mastodontic companies.
* Projects that do not exploit workers. If your model is trained by exploiting overseas and south of the world labor, this is not the place for it.
* Projects that try as much as possible to be green. Models with hundreds of billions of parameters are notoriously expensive to train in terms of water for data servers, energy that may come from fossil fuels and real estate that could be used for housing.
* Projects that try to prevent further biases, racial and social injustice, exploitation of local cultures and generally any further enshittification of internet
* Projects that respect the data used for training: copyright, voluntary participation and curation. Not mindless scraping of the web.
